# Movie Booking System (OOP Based - Python)

## What this project is

A simple console-based **Movie Ticket Booking System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.

- Check showtimes and available seats for each movie
- Book movie tickets for a selected showtime

System is controlled by the `BookingSystem` class.
